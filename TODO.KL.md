# TODO list

## 1. SLSA

Reference materials:

- <https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/generic/README.md>

## 2. Decide on the direction of data structures

Reference materials:

- <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges>
- <https://github.com/tcbrindle/flux>

## 3. Coverage 90+%

Doable, but perhaps will need to check better coverage tools.

## 4. Fuzzing tests

Because we're living in the 21st century.

## 5. Proper version handling (tied to CI)

Get rid of that #define style blog version
